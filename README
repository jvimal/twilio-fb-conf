Twilio+Freshbooks demo application
----------------------------------

This is a demo app that integrates with your
FreshBooks account and enables a project
manager to start/end a conference call with
ALL team members, using Twilio.

At the end of the call, the time-sheet is
modified to reflect the time spent in the
conference call (a phone meeting).

To run this app, please checkout this source
tree, fill in the necessary fields:

  * Twilio Account ID
  * Twilio Account secret
  * A valid Caller ID
  * The Twilio webhook's root URL, e.g.: http://testapp.com/tiwlio/

Dependencies: Install the gems listed in the
.gems file.  Also, do:

  $ cd /path/to/README/on/webserver
  $ git clone https://github.com/jdiller/ruby-freshbooks.git


To run the application:

  $ ruby app.rb

SCREENSHOT: Check a sample screenshot of the application
in twilio-fb.png

Once you're done, visit the application URL
and proceed to login. (Default: localhost:4567)

Caveats:
  * Should have used OAuth for authenticating,
    but I was late in requesting the OAuth
    credentials to the FreshBooks team.
    Currently, to authenticate, the app requires
    the developer secret key.

  * I just have a demo FreshBooks account, which
    doesn't permit more than one staff per project.
    Hence, I cannot test a conference call, as at
    least two staffs are required.

TODO:
  * Log the time sheets on a per-person basis, so
    that each person's contribution to the conference
    call is quantified.

  * Make the data stores persistent in database.
